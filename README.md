<h1 align="center">Hello World, I'm Niraj 👋</h1>

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a curious and creative Data Scientist, currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at Northeastern University. My passion lies in **Generative AI**, especially **diffusion models**, and using AI to solve real-world problems — from finance to protein design.

Previously, I worked at **MFS Investment Management**, **Tata Consultancy Services**, and **Indian Institute of Tropical Metero**, taking on diverse **Data Science roles** — accumulating **~4 years of hands-on experience** across research and industry.

Right now, I’m diving deep into **bioinformatics + AI**, exploring how generative models can help us design enzymes. I also love implementing research papers from scratch and bringing them to life.

When I’m not coding, I’m jamming on my guitar, hiking new trails, or learning about different cultures.

> 🔍 **Actively looking for Summer 2025 internships** and **full-time roles starting Jan 2026** in AI/ML Research, Data Science, or Generative AI!
